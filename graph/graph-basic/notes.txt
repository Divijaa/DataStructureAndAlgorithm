//graph

for creating graphs

adj matrix 
adj list -- map<int,list<int>>, list<int> arr[] ;




1. 
shortest path from source node (unweighted when all node have same weight)

its simply means slove by bfs...

parent = 0

then child is parent+1



2.
no.of component of graph 
like all graph are not cyclic or connected 

like some are 
1-3-4 and 9-7


can be in parts in that case create a visited array and then itterate thougth it

if element is not visited dfs through it , and then again not visted then againg dfs 


case1  1,3,4 will will be visited then 9,7 will be not visited because they are not linked 

then again start dfs from 9


3.
